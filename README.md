# Retinal-Disease-Checker
Made a project after a few months

This is my first actual app in Python. 
It's an AI that checks for eye diseases(check the app for more info). 
It takes an image as input and gives the result in a text format

Made in ~3 hours

Special thanks to Pranav Narang(popilworck)
